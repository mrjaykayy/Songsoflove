    <h1>Whispers Between Wounds</h1>
    <div class="poem">
      I’ve lost all shape, all sense, all name—<br>
      A ghost with hands that still call yours.<br>
      Would you lift the glass to my mouth<br>
      When my lips forget what they’re for?<br><br>

      If I’m drunk on pain and start to speak—<br>
      Slurred truths, regrets, soft cries,<br>
      Will you hold them like you held me once,<br>
      Or let them fade with morning skies?<br><br>

      Hug me—<span class="highlight">just once</span>—even if your arms<br>
      Are tired of carrying my weight.<br>
      Throw me away in the next breath if you must,<br>
      But give me one second of fate.<br><br>

      If I rest my head in your lap tonight,<br>
      Would you run your fingers through my shame?<br>
      Would you close your eyes and sleep with me,<br>
      Or whisper my forgotten name?<br><br>

      You don’t leave my mind. You never have.<br>
      Your silence walks through every room.<br>
      You are my heart’s illusion still—<br>
      A sweet, unending wound.<br><br>

      I have no pride left in this skin,<br>
      Only prayers stitched in your name.<br>
      You’re the last place I felt like home—<br>
      Now, nothing feels the same.<br><br>

      They warned me—<span class="highlight">don’t drink her love,</span><br>
      It’s honeyed poison, slow and sweet.<br>
      But I drank it all, with both hands shaking,<br>
      And now I rot beneath its heat.<br><br>

      What poison could I fear now,<br>
      When the cure was always you?<br>
      When I see your face, my ribs collapse—<br>
      Tell me, what more could I lose?<br><br>

      Yes, I spoke things soaked in wrong.<br>
      But I’m standing here, stripped of lies.<br>
      I’m sorry. Not in words, but in my bones—<br>
      My soul kneels where your shadow lies.<br><br>

      I love you.<br>
      Not as a line, but as a life.<br>
      As breath, as ache, as broken truth.<br>
      I love you, my wife—<br>
      <span class="highlight">You are my only proof.</span>
